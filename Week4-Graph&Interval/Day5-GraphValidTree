General Explanation:
  Base Case: If no nodes, then empty graph is tree and return true
  
  We are searching for graph with all nodes connected, and no cycles. We do this by performing DFS and keeping track of size of visited set to make sure 
  it equals the number of nodes as well as making sure along the way no cycle is created. A cycle occurs when there is any adjacent node that has already been visited 
  other than the one from which we just traveled.
  
  Time complexity is O(e+v) edges+vertices and constant time operations for each edge and vertex along the way.
