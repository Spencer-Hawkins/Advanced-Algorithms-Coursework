//Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/

/*
Runtime: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

General Explanation:  If null, then you traveled past a leaf, if not null found node so return one and travel to children nodes. 
                      Traveling to each node once is linear time so just travel to each node once.

class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null){return 0;}
        return 1+countNodes(root.left)+countNodes(root.right);
    }
}
