//Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/


/*

Runtime: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

General Explanation:  1,000,000 is beyond the max value in supplied linked list. We set that in linked list at each value we traverse. We either find a null value or
                      traverse to original point in list we began at.
