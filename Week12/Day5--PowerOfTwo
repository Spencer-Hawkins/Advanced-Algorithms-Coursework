Time Complexity:O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1)


General Explanation:  All powers of two in binary are a 1 followed by all zeros. If you use the bitwise operator & with n-1, they should share no values in 
                      common since 1 value below a 1 followed by all zeroes would be a zero followed by only ones. Follow the reference at the bottom for a
                      an ilustration.
